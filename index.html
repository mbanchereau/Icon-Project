<h1>Swedish Elections : how a far-right party with neo-Nazi roots rose to power</h1>
<byline>by Mark Banchereau</byline>

<p> A right-wing coalition lead by the Sweden Democrats (SD), a nationalist party with roots in the Neo-Nazi movement, won the Swedish General Election on September 11th.
  For the first in the country’s history, a far-right party will be part of a government coalition.
</p>

<p>Here are 4 possible explanations to the Sweden Democrats victory</p>
<ol>

<li> A campaign centred around crime</li>

<p>In recent years, Sweden has seen an increase in gang-related gun violence. The country was ranked second in Europe in gun deaths per capita over the last four years,
  according to a report from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. This had made crime a particularly salient issue in political debates.
  A 2021 poll from the University of Göteborg found that 41% of Swedes see Law and Order as the most important issue in the country, compared to only 6% in 2011.
  The Sweden Democrats “tough on crime” agenda during this election, which featured longer minimum prison sentences and the repatriation of foreign convicted of serious crimes, was therefore particularly attractive to a number of voters. </p>

<li>Creating a link between open-immigration and the crime surge</li>
<p>The fact that gun-violence in Sweden is mostly confined to immigrant-dominated suburbs, plays into the hands of the SD, who were able to link the increase in crime to
  the country openness to immigration since the 2015 migrant crisis.
<p/>
<img src="healthcare.jpg" width="100px" height="100">
<li>Strains of the welfare system</li>
<p>Given that Swedes pay some of the highest personal income taxes in the world, they are regularly concerns about decreases in the quality of healthcare.
  Recent reports show that Sweden has some of the worst wait times for emergency care in Europe.
  The Sweden Democrats have exploited this concern, accusing immigrants of straining the welfare system, pointing to the fact that the unemployment rate is
  significantly higher amongst migrants compared to the native population
<p/>
<img src="energy.jpg" width="100px" height="100">
<li>Climate change put on the back burner</li>
<p>While environmentalism has traditionally been very popular in Sweden, the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine have rearranged the leading parties
  priorities when it comes to fighting climate change. Discussions on the climate mainly took the form of debates around reopening nuclear plants to curb the
  rise of energy prices took. This significantly disadvantaged parties such as the Social Democrats and the Greens, which had made the development of green
  energies key elements of their agenda.
